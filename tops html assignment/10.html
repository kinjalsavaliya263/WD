      <abbr title="is a markup language">HTML</abbr> elements are the building
      blocks of a HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects
      such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. <br />
      HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting
      structural semantics for text such as
      <b><i>headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items</i></b>
      <br />
      HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using
      <u>angle brackets</u> . Tags such as
      <code style="color: green">&lt;img&gt;</code> and
      <code style="color: green">&lt;input&gt;</code> directly intoduce content
      into the page. <br />
      Other tags such as <code style="color: green">&lt;p&gt;</code> surround
      and provide information about document text and may include other tags as
      sub-elements. <br />
      Browsers do not display the html tags but use them to interpret the
      content of the page.
