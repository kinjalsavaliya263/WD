--> 2) How to embed audio and video in a webpage?
        To embed audio in HTML, we use the <audio> tag. Before HTML5, audio cannot be added to web pages in the Internet Explorer era. 
        To play audio, we used web plugins like Flash. After the release of HTML5, it is possible. This tag supports Chrome, Firefox, Safari, 
        Opera, and Edge in three audio formats – MP3, WAV, OGG. Only Safari browser doesn’t support OGG audio format.
           <audio>
              <source src="file_name" type="audio_file_type">
           </audio>
        To embed video in HTML, we use the <video> tag. It contains one or more video sources at a time using <source> tag. It supports MP4, 
        WebM, and Ogg in all modern browsers. Only Ogg video format doesn’t support in Safari browser. 
           <video>
             <source src="file_name" type="video_file_type">
           </video>
           
--> 3) Semantic element in HTML5 ?
        A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
        Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content. 
        Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.
        
--> 4) Canvas and  SVG tags
        SVG: The Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based image format that is used to define two-dimensional vector-based graphics for the 
        web. Unlike raster image (Ex .jpg, .gif, .png, etc.), a vector image can be scaled up or down to any extent without losing the image quality.
        An SVG image is drawn out using a series of statements that follow the XML schema — that means SVG images can be created and edited with any 
        text editor, such as Notepad. There are several other advantages of using SVG over other image formats like JPEG, GIF, PNG, etc.
        
        Canvas: The HTML element is used to draw graphics on the fly, via scripting (usually JavaScript). The element is only a container for graphics.
        You must use a script to actually draw the graphics. Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.
